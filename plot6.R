#Question: Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in
#       Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in
#       Los Angeles County, California (fips == "06037").
#       Which city has seen greater changes over time in
#       motor vehicle emissions?

#Plan: Have '99 be the baseline for each area and make a line chart
#       of change per recording-period ('99-'02, '02-'05, '05-'08)
#       plot both on top of eachother and color code the regions
